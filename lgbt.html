		<p>Though there have been several great feats for member of the LGBT community, such as the legalization of LGBT marriage, there are still several challenges. Many people face social and cultural prejudice as well as violence in several extreme cases. Many people around the world are not accepting of this new right. People are refused services solely because of their sexuality. In the past several years, there have been multiple of acts of violence to the community. Some see LGBT people as minorities and therefore deserving of violence. There is still not equality for all member of the community, such as transgender people.</p>
